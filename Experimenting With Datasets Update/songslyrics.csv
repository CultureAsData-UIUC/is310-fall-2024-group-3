When the world has dealt its cards

Men steady comin' after you

Women steady comin' after me

Seem like everybody wanna go for self

And don't wanna respect boundaries

Tellin' you all those lies

Just to get on your side

But I must admit there was a couple secrets

I held inside

But just know that I tried

To always apologize

And I'ma have you first always in my heart

To keep you satisfied



Got every right to wanna leave

Got every right to wanna go

Got every right to hit the road

And never talk to me no more

You don't even have to call

Even check for me at all

Because the way I been actin' lately

Has been off the wall

Especially toward you

Puttin' girls before you

And they watchin' everything I been doin'

Just to hurt you

Most of it just ain't you

Ain't true

And they won't show you

How much of a queen you are to me

And why I love you baby

Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad

I wonder if it even makes a difference to try

Decisions that made my bed

Now I must lay in it

And deal with things I left unsaid

I want to dive into you

Forget what you're going through

I get behind, make your move

Looking like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls

Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers



Steps upstage, didn't think I saw

Creeps up behind me, she's like ""YOU'RE -""

I'm like, ""Yeah, I know, let's cut to the chase""

No time to waste, back to my place

Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away

Or more like a palace, shall I say

I'm hot cuz im fly, 

You ain't cuz you not, 

This is why (this is why)

This is why Im hot

I'm hot cuz im fly, 

You hate cuz you not (M.I.M.S.!)

This is why (this is why)

This is why I'm hot.



[Verse 1:]

This is why I'm hot, I don't gotta rap

I could sell a mil. sayin' nothing on the track

I represent New York, I got it on my back, 

Niggas say that we lost it, so imma bring it back.

I love the Dirty Dirty, cuz niggas show me love

The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club.

But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow,

So when I hit that shit, I watch em (get it on the flo')

And if you need it hyphy, I'll take it to the Bay,

'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it everyday.

Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit LA, 

I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way.

And when I hit the Chi', people tell me that I'm fly.

They like the way I dress, they like my attire.

They love how I move crowds from side-to-side,

They ask me how I do it, and simply I reply: 



[Chorus:]

This is why Im hot

This is why Im hot

This is why (this is why)

You hate cuz you not (M.I.M.S.!)

This is why (this is why)

This is why I'm hot.



[Verse 2:]

This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block,

Every other day, another bitch, another drop, 

16 bars, 24 a pop, 

44 a song, nigga gimme what chu got.

I'm into drivin cars, fresh up off the lot , 

Im into shuttin stores down, just so I could shop.

If you need a bird, I could get it chopped, 

Tell me what chu need, you know I get em by the flock.

I call my homie Black, meet me on the Avvve.

I hit Wash. Heights with the money in the bag.

We into big spendin', you see my pimpin' never drag,

Find me with different women that you niggas never had.

For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my green

Playa you come between, you better focus on the beam.

I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean,

And when I say Im hot, my nigga this is what I mean 



[chorus:]

This is why Im hot

This is why Im hot

This is why (this is why)

This is why Im hot

[x2]

I'm hot cuz im fly, 

You ain't cuz you not, 

This is why (this is why)

This is why Im hot

I'm hot cuz im fly, 

You hate cuz you not (M.I.M.S.!)

This is why (this is why)

This is why I'm hot.



[verse 3:]

This is why im hot, shorty see the drop

Asked me what I paid, and I say yeah, I paid a guap.

And then I hit the switch, that take away the top,

So chicks around the way, they call me Creame of the Crop.

They hop in the car, I tell em ?All aboard?

We hit the studio, they say they like how I record.

I gave em Black Train and I Did You Wrong, 

So everytime I see them, they tell me that's their song. 

They say I'm the bomb,

They love the way the charm, 

Hangin from the neck, and compliments the arm, 

Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear, 

So when I hit the room, the shorties stop 'n stare.

Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face, 

But little do they know, I keep them thangs by waist

Son I reply, nobody got to die, 

Similar to Lil' Weez cuz I got the fire. 



[Chorus:]

This is why Im hot

This is why Im hot

This is why (this is why)

This is why Im hot

I'm hot cuz im fly, 

You ain't cuz you not,

We missed you on the charts last week, damn, that's right you wasn't there

If se-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shi-it-it

Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it

So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way

If you got a man, try to lose him if you can

Cause the girls worldwide throw their hands up high

When they wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy

'cause you ain't been seen wit a man so fly

Baby friends so fly i can go fly

Private, cause I handle mine

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny

I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try

You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?

Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie

You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high

I want a brand new house

On an episode of Cribs

And a bathroom I can play baseball in

And a king size tub big enough

For ten plus me



(So what you need?)



I'll need a credit card that's got no limit

And a big black jet with a bedroom in it

Gonna join the mile high club

At thirty-seven thousand feet



(Been there, done that)



I want a new tour bus full of old guitars

My own star on Hollywood Boulevard

Somewhere between Cher and

James Dean is fine for me



(So how you gonna do it?)



I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame

I'd even cut my hair and change my name



'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars

And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars

The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap

We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars

In the VIP with the movie stars

Every good gold digger's

Gonna wind up there

Every Playboy bunny

With her bleach blond hair



Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar



I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels

Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes

Sign a couple autographs

So I can eat my meals for free

(I'll have the quesadilla ha ha)

I'm gonna dress my ass

With the latest fashion

Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion

Gonna date a centerfold that loves to

Blow my money for me

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar



I'm gonna sing those songs

That offend the censors

Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser



I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs

lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you 
& I'm wishing that you would come back through my door
Why did you have to go? You could have let me know

So now I'm all alone, 

Girl you could have stayed 

but you wouldnt give me a chance

With you not around it's a little bit more then i can stand

And all my tears they keep running down my face

Why did you turn away?



[Bridge]



So why does your pride make you run and hide?

Are you that afraid of me? 

But I know it's a lie what you keep inside

This is not how you wanted to be



[Chorus]



So baby I will wait for you

Cause I don''t know what else i can do

Don't tell me I ran out of time

If it takes the rest of my life



Baby I will wait for you

If you think I'm fine it just aint true

I really need you in my life

No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you



[Verse 2]



It's been a long time since you called me

(How could you forget about me)

You got me feeling crazy (crazy)

How can you walk away,

Everything stays the same

I just can't do it baby

What will it take to make you come back

Girl I told you what it is & it just ain't like that

Why can't you look at me, your still in love with me

Don't leave me crying.



[Bridge]



Baby why can't we just start over again

Get it back to the way it was

If you give me a chance I can love you right

But your telling me it wont be enough



[Chorus]



So baby I will wait for you

Cause I don''t know what else i can do

Don't tell me I ran out of time

If it takes the rest of my life



Baby I will wait for you

If you think I'm fine it just aint true

I really need you in my life

No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you



[Bridge]



So why does you pride make you run & hide

Are you that afriad of me?

But I know it's a lie what your keeping inside

Thats not how you wanted to be



Baby I will wait for you

Baby I will wait for you

If it's the last thing i do



[Chorus]



Baby I will wait for you

Cause I don''t know what else i can do

Don't tell me I ran out of time

And she treats me like a dawg, watches for the hit.

Checks where I go, even watches who I'm wit.

The right when I'm wrong, so I never slip.

Show me how to move, that's why I never trip.

And baby girl, you so major, they should front-page ya (front page ya).

God bless the parents who made ya (who made ya).

First, let me explain that I'm just a black man, 

And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man, 

My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet 

Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at 

But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me 

I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see, 

I was in the fast lane chasin my dream, 

And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me, 

Goin crazyyyy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it, 

But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater, 

And I been in so many collisions by puttin shit off till later.

It's like I'm takin five steps forward, and ten steps back 

Tryna get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track 

And I keep runnin away the ones that say they love me the most 

How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh, 

I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and 

It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and 

Lord, would you help me? And stop this pain 

I keep inflinctin on my family (family)

It's hard to manage cause every days a challenge and man 

And I'm slippin can't lose my balance and tryin not to panic

My father took me into the city
To see a marching band.
He said, ""Son when you grow up,
would you be the savior of the broken, 

the beaten and the damned?""

He said ""Will you defeat them,

your demons, and all the non-believers, 

the plans that they have made?""

""Because one day I'll leave you,

A phantom to lead you in the summer,

To join The Black Parade.""



When I was a young boy,

My father took me into the city

To see a marching band.

He said, ""Son when you grow up,

would you be the savior of the broken, 

the beaten and the damned?""



Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me.

And other times I feel like I should go.

And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets.

And when you're gone we want you all to know.



We'll carry on,

We'll carry on

And though you're dead and gone believe me

Your memory will carry on

We'll carry on

And in my heart I can't contain it

The anthem won't explain it.



A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams

Your misery and hate will kill us all.

So paint it black and take it back

Let's shout it loud and clear

Defiant to the end we hear the call



To carry on

We'll carry on

And though you're dead and gone believe me

Your memory will carry on

We'll carry on

And though you're broken and defeated

Your weary widow marches



On and on we carry through the fears

Ooh oh ohhhh

Disappointed faces of your peers

Ooh oh ohhhh

Take a look at me cause I could not care at all



Do or die, you'll never make me

Because the world will never take my heart

Go and try, you'll never break me

We want it all, we wanna play this part

I won't explain or say I'm sorry

I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar

Give a cheer for all the broken

Listen here, because it's who we are

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero

Just a boy, who had to sing this song

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero

I! don't! care!



We'll carry on

We'll carry on

And though you're dead and gone believe me

Your memory will carry on

We'll carry on

And though you're broken and defeated

Your weary widow marches on



Do or die, you'll never make me

Because the world will never take my heart

Go and try, you'll never break me

We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)

I understand why you wanna try 

Make him stay home late at night

But if wanna go he'll be gone no lie

I can't explain how many times I tried

How many times I cried

Thinkin about mine and where he might be

Remember when I gave everything I got

Couldn't get deep down inside

How ya love someone who didn't love me



[Hook 1]

But now I get if he don't wanna

Love you the right way he ain't gonna

It ain't where he's at it's where he

Kick em all straight to the curb like Beckham

Broke up wit my Ex he wit her for now but

Little do she know she just a rebound

Callin my phone she so outta pocket

I been there before o'girl you need to stop it

Trickin on me when he tell you he ain't got it

You don't get the picture

My pictures in his wallet

Never ever thought I would leave him alone

But I let a dog roam now he wanna come home

But I

Don't trust him

Though I still love him

No longer want him

Lookin at his cousin

Kinda buzzin

Loose off the goose

Got him on a chase like cranberry juice

When he's wit you he's wishin it was me

You might be where he's at but I'm where

He wanna be (Baby Baby!)

What makes her just everything that I can never be

What makes her your every dream and fantasy

I remember you would shiver everytime I said your name

You said nothing felt as good as when you gaze into my eyes

Now you don't care I'm alive

I'm sitting looking out the window like damn 

Tryna fix this situation that's at hand 

You still running through my mind when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be, 

Me all on yo mind and I'm knowing that it couldn't be 

Cause you ain't call and I ain't even appalled 

I still got allot of pain I ain't dealt wit it all 

I been running round with other chicks, I'm single and they loving it, I'm liking it but I just want the one that I was in love with. 

That's not the end of it, I'm tryna let you know I can't, 

Get a grip of it is what I'm tryna let you know. 

You got a hold or some kind of control of me 

I don't know what it is, but I gotta get you gone from me 

I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better just tryna be like, yeah, forget it, whatever Instead of staring out this glass looking at this bad weather, damn I gotta pull myself together 

Cause...

When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do

You know what you do to me (do to me) 

You don't even understand (damn) 

You know what you do to me (do to me) 

It's so hard to get you outta my system. 



[Verse 2] 



I'm too attached, my heart won't let me fall back 

I got it bad, that's what you can call that (ah) 

When I see you in the streets, that's the worse for me 

Used to love the little things you did, that's what works for me 

It's too major, don't see you on my pager, 

Know what you doing, where you at, or can I see you later? (Can I see you later?) 

The fellas telling me 'just let her go Bow', believe me, I'm trying man, I just don't know how 

(Just don't know how) 

I be in all the top spots, leaving with the hot shots, knowing they just want me cause I'm in the top spot 

That's not poppin and my brain aint stopping, thinking 

Who she with, or where she going, is she club hoppin? 

I never had this kind of problem in my life, this is my first time dealing with this kind of fight 

It's every night and every flight and every time you in my sight, 

Damn this aint even right, cause...

I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean

My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode

So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go



Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean

Got a ride that's smoother than a limosine

Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?

If you can baby boy then we can go all night



'Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five

Baby you got the keys

Now shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)



I got class like a '57 Cadillac

Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back

You look like you can handle what's under my hood

You keep saying that you will boy I wish you would

Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain

For the very first time with you

My heart melts into the ground

Found something true

And everyone's looking round

Thinking I'm going crazy

Trying hard not to hear

But they talk so loud

Their piercing sounds fill my ears

Try to fill me with doubt

Yet I know that the goal

Is to keep me from falling



But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace

And in this world of loneliness

I see your face

Yet everyone around me

Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe



But I don't care what they say

I'm in love with you

Long live the king!""

For some reason I can't explain 

Once you go there was never, never an honest word

Blew down the doors to let me in

Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Revolutionaries wait 

For my head on a silver plate 

Just a puppet on a lonely string

Oh who would ever want to be king?

[Verse 1:]

Turn the lights off in this place

And she shines just like a star

And I swear I know her face

I just don't know who you are

Turn the music up in here

I still hear her loud and clear

Like she's right there in my ear

Tellin me that she wants to own me

To control me

Come closer

Come closer

And I just can't pull myself away

Under her spell I can't break

I just can't stop

I just can't stop

And I just can't free myself away

But I don't want to escape

I just can't stop

I just can't stop

I just can't stop



[Verse 2:]

I can feel her on my skin

I can taste her on my tongue

She's the sweetest taste of sin

The more I get the more I want

She wants to own me

Come closer

She says come closer

And I just can't pull myself away

Under her spell I can't break

Soul is in danger I gotta let my spirit be free

When we're on the phone and you talk real slow

Cause it's late and your mama don't know

Our song is the way you laugh

The first date ""man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""

And when I got home ... before I said amen

Asking God if he could play it again



I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day

Had gone all wrong and been trampled on

And lost and thrown away

Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed

I almost didn't notice all the roses

And the note that said...



[Repeat Chorus]



I've heard every album, listened to the radio

Waited for something to come along

That was as good as our song...

Sneaking out late, tapping on his window

When we're on the phone and he talks real slow

Cause it's late and his mama don't know

And the dreams that we had

I'm in a world that try to take them away 

Oh but I'm taking them back

Without something there to remind me

Was it all that easy

To just put aside your feelings

Don’t wanna let, hurt my feelings

High school she was

That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym

(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)

Never thought she would come and work for the president

Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)

She thought he'd call (where my money at?)

She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day

All she wanna know is (where my money at?)

Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread

All you wanna know is (where my money at?)

She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard

Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter

On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of

Rather be up in the club shakin' for a thug

For triple times the money and spending it how they wanna

They got they mind on they money, money on they mind

They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines

See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind

And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line



But I know there's a drop in the block

You move slow

You getting' pressure from cops

you don't know not to lay low

Because 25 to life is no joke

To all my real gorillas thuggin'

On top of corners every day strugglin'

All the beautiful women getting' money

Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

She used to be the sweetest girl ever

Now she like sour ameretta

She wears a dress to the T like the letter

And if you make it rain she will be under the weather

She used to run track back in high school

Now she tricks off the track right by school

She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose

So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used

And then she runs to the pastor

And he tells her there will be a new chapter

But she feels no different after

And then she asks him...

Call up a girl that I used to know

Fake love for an hour or so

Who says I can't get stoned?



Who says I can't take time?

Meet all the girls on the county line

Then wait on fate to send a sign

Plan a trip to Japan alone

Doesn't matter if I even go

[Verse 1:]

Yea, uh

A fresh cool young Lu

Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2

Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue

The world brought me to my knees

What have you brung you

Did you improve on the design

Did you do something new

Well your name ain't on the guest list

Who brung you, you

The more famous person you come through

And the sexy lady next to you

You come to

And then it hit me

Standing outside of heaven waiting for god to come and get me

Im too uncouth

Unschooled to the rules

And two gum shoe

Too much of a newcomer

And too uncool

Like Shadow and Lavelle

I battle with it well

Though I need a holiday like lady who song blue

Go back what ever you did you undo

Heavy is heaven

The devil on my two tons too

[Verse 2:]

And you better wear your shades

The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage

Down through the basement

Passed the Indian graves

Where the dinosaurs laid

And out through china

Nearly misses air liners

Magnified times five

This is pointed at the rhymer

Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze

Now that's important to say

Cuz even with all of that

Most of us don't want it to fade

We want it to braid

Meaning we want it to grow

Meaning we want it to stay

Like the governor called

And they told him to wait

Un-strap him from the chair

And put him back in his cage

The audience ain't fazed

And they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise

They want everything back that they paid

Cuz they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away

Cuz I been standing in this line

For like five whole days

Me and security ain't getting along

And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone

So just take me home where the mood is mellow

And the roses are thrown

M&M's are yellow

And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker

Everybody gets a nice autograph picture

One for you and one for your sister

Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener

Every songs a favorite song

And mikes don't feed back

All the reviewers say you need to go and see that

And everybody claps cuz everybody is pleased

Then they all take the stage and start performing for me

Like ha ha hahaha

Ha ha hahaha ha

And I'm out on the edge of forever 

Ready to run 

I'm keeping my feet on the ground 

Arms open wide

Oh...

swinging in your back yard,

all the things that we used to do

We were cool back in high school

ooh I really liked you,

must have been your attitude.

That's why you keep on running

in and out of my mind.

As the years they'll roll by,

Baby, now I know why

I keep coming back to you.

look at what you've shown me,

Well this life tried to keep us apart

you keep calling me back to your heart

Let me hear you say

I'm so glad you found me,

wrap your world around me,

never find a love like this.

man they was putting you down.

And now they see we rolling,

me and you, we strolling,

they don't wanna come around.

When this life tries to keep us apart,

you keep calling me back to your heart.

Let me hear you say,

I'm so glad you found me,

wrap you all around me,

never find a love like this,



Oh... Never find a love like this...

When this life tried to keep us apart,

you keep calling me back to your heart,

Let me hear you say,

Oh... Never find a love like this.

Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone

How many times did I tell ya fo it finally got through

You lose, you lose

See I had to go, see I had to move

No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life

Something happened for the first time
Deep inside
There's a rush, what a rush
Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way

About me

It's just too much, just too much



Why do I keep running from the truth

All I ever think about is you

You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized

And I just got to know



Do you ever think

When you're all alone

All that we can be

Where this thing could go

Am I crazy or falling in love

Is it real or just another crush

Do you catch your breath

When I look at you

Are you holding back

Like the way I do

Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away

But I know this crush ain't going away, going away



Has it ever crossed your mind

When were hangin, spending time girl,

Are we just friends

Is there more, is there more

See it's a chance we've gotta take

Cause I believe that we can make this into

Something that will last, last forever, forever



Do you ever think

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd

And say, ""Hello""

Little did I know



That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""

And I was crying on the staircase

Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said



Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""



So I sneak out to the garden to see you

We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes

Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh



'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""

But you were everything to me

I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said



Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel

This love is difficult, but it's real

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess

It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""



Oh, oh



And I got tired of waiting

Wondering if you were ever coming around

My faith in you was fading

When I met you on the outskirts of town



And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone

I keep waiting for you, but you never come

Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

I love you and that's all I really know

I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

Having a really good time, I'm not complaining

And I'm a still wear a smile if it raining

I got to enjoy myself regardless

I appreciate life, I'm so glad I got mine

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me



When I'm walking past the mirror

Aint worried about you and what you gonna do

I'm a lady so I must stay classy

Got to keep it hot, keep it together

If I want to get better

You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just.....

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh

Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh

You see I won't change my life, my life's just fine

(I ain't gone let nobody bring me down, no, no, no)

No matter what nobody has to say

(No way, no way, no way)

I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way

No matter what nobody has to say



Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you want to do

Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new

It's a really good thing to say

That I won't change my life, my life's just fine



Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh

Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh



Splashing through the sand bar

Talking by the campfire

It's the simple things in life, like when and where

We didn't have no internet

But man I never will forget

The way the moonlight shined upon her hair



And we were trying different things

We were smoking funny things

Making love out by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long



Catching Walleye from the dock

Watching the waves roll off the rocks

She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul

We'd blister in the sun

We couldn't wait for night to come

To hit that sand and play some rock and roll



While we were trying different things

And we were smoking funny things

Making love out by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long



Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change

Or how we thought those days would never end

Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along

And think man I'd love to see that girl again



And we were trying different things

We were smoking funny things

Making love out by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley

Take me away, like I overdosed on cocaine

Or take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain

From a block close to where Biggie was crucified

That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin reason

And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces (my life, my life)

Cause that's Jesus people, and Game, he's the equal

Hated on some much +Passion+ that Christ need a sequel

Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella need a Sigel

Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle (my life, my life)

I need some meditation, so I can lead my people

They askin why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?

And why every hood nigga feed off evil?

Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

[The Game] + (Lil Wayne)

We are not the same, I am a Martian

So approach my Phantom doors with caution

You see them 24's spinnin? I earned 'em

And all the pictures of me and Em, I burned 'em

So it ain't no proof, that I ever walked through 8 Mile

And since it ain't no Proof, I'll never walk through 8 Mile

Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down

Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile (my life, my life)

Damn, I know his momma proud

And since you helped me sell my +Dream+ we can share my momma now

And like M.J.B., +No More Drama+ now

Livin the +Good Life+, me and Common on common ground

I spit crack, and niggaz could drop it out of town

Got a Cris', call my estate, I'm never out of bounds

My life used to be empty like a glock without a round

Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds

[The Game] + (Lil Wayne)

Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front

With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin chronic blunts

Listenin to the Chronic album, play it backwards

Shootin at pictures of Don Imus for target practice

My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood

I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge

{Compton, Compton} Made my grandmother pray for good

It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could (my life, my life)

Ain't no bars, but niggaz can't escape the hood

It took so many of my niggaz, that I should hate the hood

But it's real niggaz like me, that make the hood

Ridin slow in that Phantom just the way I should (my life, my life)

With the top back, in my Sox hat

I'm +Paid in Full+, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that

Even if they brought the nigga 'Pac back

I'll still keep this motherfucker cocked back

You're the one thing that remains.

We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes

No room left to move inbetween you and I

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd

And say, ""Hello""

Little did I know



That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""

And I was crying on the staircase

Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said



Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""



So I sneak out to the garden to see you

We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes

Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh



'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""

But you were everything to me

I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said



Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel

This love is difficult, but it's real

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess

It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""



Oh, oh



And I got tired of waiting

Wondering if you were ever coming around

My faith in you was fading

When I met you on the outskirts of town



And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone

I keep waiting for you, but you never come

Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

I love you and that's all I really know

I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer

But my breath fogged up the glass

And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons

It's what we aim to do

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town

I havent seen it in awhile, since she brought you down

You say you find I know you better than that

Hey, Whatcha doing with a girl like that?

So please, don't mess up the trick, hey young world I'm the new slick rick

They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us

Let the hourglass pass right into ashes



Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses

So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask, someone that's only average

For advice, OMG, you listen to that bitch?

Whoa, it's me, baby this is tragic

'Cause we had it, we was magic



I was flyin', now I'm crashin'

This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson

Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson

You should leave your boyfriend now, I'mma ask him



Say you gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad

So will u bring a better future than I had in the past

Oh Cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did

I don't wanna fall back on my face again

Whoa, whoa, I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call

Whoa, whoa, and if it hits better make it worth the fall

(When it comes around)



Sometimes love comes around

(Love comes around)

And it knocks you down

Just get back up

When it knocks you down

(Knocks you down)

Sometimes love comes around

(Love comes around)

And it knocks you down

Just get back up

When it knocks you down

(Knocks you down)



Won't see it coming when it happens, hey

But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now

You see when love knocks you down



Won't see it coming when it happens

But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now

You see when love knocks you down

Yeah

You know alot of girls be thinking my songs are about them
But this is not to get confused
This one's for you
[Chorus:]

Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted

We can do it real big

Bigger than you ever done it

You be up on everything

Other hoes ain't never on it

I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it



Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up

When I get right I promise that we gon live it up

She make me beg for it till she give it up

And I say the same thing every single time



I say you the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the fucking best

You the best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had

Best I ever had

I say you the fucking



[Verse 1:]

Know you got a roommate

Call me when it's no one there

Put the key under the mat

And you know I'll be over there

(Yup) I'll be over there

Shawty, I'll be over there

I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there

Ha. And you ain't even have to ask twice

You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice

Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life

Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life

Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on

That's when you're the prettiest

I hope that you don take it wrong

You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along

You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home

And she a patient in my waiting room

Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume

And until them girls prove it

I'm the one to never get confused with cause



[Chorus:]

Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted

We can do it real big

Bigger than you ever done it

You be up on everything

Other hoes ain't never on it

I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it

[Verse 2:]

Sex, Love, Pain

Baby I be on that tank shit

Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk

When my album drop

Bitches will buy it for the picture

And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister

Magazine paper girl

But money ain't the issue

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial

She call me the referee

'Cause I be so official

My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make ya pussy whistle

Like the Andy Griffith theme song

And who told you to put them jeans on

Double cup love

You the one I lean on

Feeling for a fix then you should really get ya pheen on

Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot

Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot

Get it from the back

And make ya fucking bra strap pop

All up in ya slot until the nigga hit the jackpot, sang...



[Chorus:]

Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted

We can do it real big

Bigger than you ever done it

You be up on everything

Said why you always running

In place?

Moon disappears

Somewhere in the 

Stratosphere

Tell my mother,

Tell my father

I've done the best I can

To make them realise

This is my life

I hope they understand

I'm not angry, I'm just saying...

Sometimes goodbye 

Is a second chance



Please don't cry

One tear for me

I'm not afraid of

What I have to say

This is my one and

Only voice

So listen close, it's

Only for today

Comet she waved

Said why you always running

In place?

Moon disappears

Heres my chance

This is my chance



Tell my mother,

Tell my father

I've done the best I can

He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade

Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made

A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep

The girl he wants don't seem to want him too

It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

He seems alive though he is feeling blue

They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes

He smokes a clip and then he's on the way

To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of

(Asking questions like you already know)

We're fighting this war, but baby both of us are losing

What happened to working it out?

We fall into this place where you ain't backing down

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know,

Never know enough, 'til it's over love

'Til we lose control, system overload

Screamin' ""No! No! No! N-No!""

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to

See I wanna move, but can't escape from you

So I keep it low, keep a secret code

So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love locked down

Your love locked down

Keepin' your love locked down

Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down

Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down

[Verse:]

I'm not lovin' you the way I wanted to

I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true

I got somethin to lose, so I gotta move

I can't keep myself, and still keep you too

So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own

Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone

How many times did I tell ya fo it finally got through

You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to

See I had to go, see I had to move

No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life

We're just wastin' time, where's the finish line

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to

I bet no one knew, I got no one new

I know I said I'm through, but got love for you

But I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to

Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' goin'

Keep it on a roll, only God knows

If I be with you, baby I'm confused

You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to

Where I wanna go, I don't need you

I've been down this road, too many times before

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for...
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,

The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:

Slim Shady!



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle

Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn

And we're starting this party from dusk



Ok... let's go



[Eminem:]

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk

Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust

Just one up my mothers son who got thrown under the bus

Kiss my butt. Lick from under cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks

It's a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.

Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.

Fist the cut. The lady give her eighty some paper cut.

Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought

Cause when I spit the verse the shit

Gets worse and worse cause your soft

If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time

Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.

I venture to say with the center of attention it's true

Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal

Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model.

You just hit the lotto.

O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?

I noticed there's so many of them

And there's really not that many of us.

Ladies love us and my posses kicking up dust.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre



[Dr Dre:]

They see that low rider go by there, like Oh my!

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why.

I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.

I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.

Cause over and above all, it's just another day

And this one begins where the last one ends.

Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.

I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.

Driving around with a smashed front end

Let's cash that one in.

Grab another one from out the stable

The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado

The hell if I know.

Do I want leather seats or vinyl?

Decisions, decision

Garage looks like precision collision.

Or maico beats quake like Waco

Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though



[Chorus: Eminem]

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

Don't act like a snobby model .

You just hit the lotto.

It's on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.



And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent



[50 Cent:]

It's bottle after bottle

The money ain't a thang when you party with me

It's what we into it's simple

We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe

I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm king kong

Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on

I'm so calm through vietnam ring the alarm

Bring the shaun dawn burn marajaun do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what

Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls

I'd kick it with who I wanted

And I'd never get confronted for it.

Cause they'd stick up for me.



If I were a boy

I think I could understand

How it feels to love a girl

I swear I'd be a better man.

I'd listen to her

Cause I know how it hurts

When you lose the one you wanted

Cause he's taken you for granted

And everything you had got destroyed



If I were a boy

I would turn off my phone

Tell everyone it's broken

So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone

I'd put myself first

And make the rules as I go

Cause I know that she'd be faithful

Waitin' for me to come home (to come home)



If I were a boy

I think I could understand

How it feels to love a girl

I swear I'd be a better man.

I'd listen to her

Cause I know how it hurts

When you lose the one you wanted

Cause he's taken you for granted

And everything you had got destroyed



It's a little too late for you to come back

Say it's just a mistake

Think I'd forgive you like that

If you thought I would wait for you

You thought wrong



If I were a boy

I think I could understand

How it feels to love a girl

I swear I'd be a better man.

I'd listen to her

Cause I know how it hurts

When you lose the one you wanted

Cause he's taken you for granted

And everything you had got destroyed



But you're just a boy

You don't understand

Yeah you don't understand

How it feels to love a girl someday

You wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her

You don't care how it hurts

Until you lose the one you wanted

Cause you've taken her for granted

And everything you have got destroyed

But you're just a boy",2008.0

Long live the king!""

Next the walls were closed on me

Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

Blew down the doors to let me in

Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Revolutionaries wait 

For my head on a silver plate 

Just a puppet on a lonely string

Oh who would ever want to be king?

If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere

You'd think me rude, but I

Would just stand and stare.



I'd like to make myself believe

That planet Earth turns slowly.



It's hard to say that I'd

Rather stay awake when I'm asleep,

Cause everything is never as it seems.



Cause I'd get a thousand hugs

From ten thousand lightening bugs

As they tried to teach me how to dance.



A foxtrot above my head,

A sock-hop beneath my bed,

The disco ball is just hanging by a thread.



I'd like to make myself believe

That planet Earth turns slowly.

It's hard to say that I'd

Rather stay awake when I'm asleep,

Cause everything is never as it seems.

(When I fall asleep.)



Leave my door open just a crack.

(Please take me away from here.)

Cause I feel like such an insomniac.

(Please take me away from here.)



Why do I tire of counting sheep?

(Please take me away from here.)

When I'm far too tired to fall asleep



To ten million fireflies.

I'm weird, cause I hate goodbyes

I got misty eyes as they said farewell



But I'll know where several are

If my dreams get real bizarre

Cause I saved a few,

And I keep them in a jar.



I'd like to make myself believe

That planet Earth turns slowly.

It's hard to say that I'd

Rather stay awake when I'm asleep,

Cause everything is never as it seems.

(When I fall asleep.)



I'd like to make myself believe

That planet Earth turns slowly.

It's hard to say that I'd

Rather stay awake when I'm asleep

Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds

Not wrappin' this in ribbons

Held onto it forever, just pushing it down

It felt so good to let go of it now

There's nothing here in this soul left to save

Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow

God knows we tried to find an easier way

But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

The warm embrace that no one knows

The lovin' look that's left your eyes

That's why this comes as no, as no surprise



If I could see the future and how this plays out

I bet it's better than where we are now

But after going through this

It's easier to see the reason why

The whispering before we sleep,

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me,

Moon's awake now... with eyes wide open

My body is craving... so feed the hungry



I've devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday

Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it

Starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office (ah)

Open up and set her free (ahuuu}

There's a she wolf in the closet,

Let it out so it can breathe 



Sitting across the bar, 



staring right at her pray,

It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way.

Nocturnal creatures... are not so prudent,

The moon's my teacher... and I'm her student.



To look at the single man I've got on me a special radar,

And the fire department's hotline in case I get in trouble later

Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy (ah)

I'm having a very good time in the heat, very bad in the arms of a boy

Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me

He said each day's a gift and not a given right 
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind 
And try to take the path less traveled by 
That first step you take is the longest stride 


If today was your last day 

and tomorrow was too late 

Could you say goodbye to yesterday? 

Would you live each moment like your last? 

Leave old pictures in the past 

Donate every dime you have? 

If today was your last day 



Against the grain should be a way of life 

What's worth the prize is always worth the fight 

Every second counts 'cause there's no second try 

So live like you'll never live it twice 

Don't take the free ride in your own life 



If today was your last day 

and tomorrow was too late 

Could you say goodbye to yesterday? 

Would you live each moment like your last? 

Leave old pictures in the past 

Donate every dime you have? 

Would you call old friends you never see? 

Reminisce of memories 

Would you forgive your enemies? 

Would you find that one you're dreamin' of? 

Swear up and down to God above 

That you finally fall in love 

If today was your last day 



If today was your last day 

Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart? 

You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars 

Regardless of who you are 

So do whatever it takes 

'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life 

Let nothin' stand in your way 

Cause the hands of time are never on your side 



If today was your last day 

and tomorrow was too late 

Could you say goodbye to yesterday? 



Would you live each moment like your last? 

Leave old pictures in the past 

Donate every dime you have? 

Would you call old friends you never see?

Would you forgive your enemies? 

Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?

If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air?
That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it

I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed but my good friends is all I need

Pass out at 3, wake up at 10, go out to eat then do it again

Man, I love college



I wanna go to college for the rest of my life

Sip Banker's Club and drink Miller Lite

On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice

And I can get pizza a dollar a slice



So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up

I'm next on the table, who want what?

I am champion at beer pong

Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon



Don't even bounce, not in my house

Better hope you make it otherwise you naked

Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted

Woke up today and all I could say is



Um, that party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it

I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed but my good friends is all I need

Pass out at 3, wake up at 10, go out to eat then do it again



Man, I love college, ay!

And I love drinking, ay!

I love women, ay!

Man, I love college



I can't tell you what I learned from school but

I could tell you a story or two, um

Yeah, of course I learned some rules

Like don't pass out with your shoes on

(Get the Sharpie!)



And don't leave the house 'til the booze gone

(No, we're not leaving)

And don't have sex if she's too gone

When it comes to condoms put two on

(Trust me)

Then tomorrow night find a new jawn



Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun

(Here, hold this)

Even if we did get a little bit too drunk

Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted

Woke up today and all I could say is



That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it

(I wish we taped)

I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed but my good friends is all I need

Pass out at 3, wake up at 10, go out to eat then do it again



Man, I love college, ay!

I love drinking, ay!

I love women, ay!

I love college



Now if everybody would please

Put their drink as high as they can

As high as they can

(As high as they can)

And repeat after me



Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

Freshmen! Freshmen!

Freshmen! Freshmen!



Do something' crazy! Do somethin' crazy!

Do something' crazy! Do somethin' crazy!

Keg stand! Keg stand!

Keg stand! Keg stand!

Man, I love college

I love it!

(That party last night)

Alright everybody, I gotta head back to class for a little bit



That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it

(I wish we taped)

I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed but my good friends is all I need

And you feel yourself suffocating? 
Does the pain weigh out the pride? 

And you look for a place to hide? 

Did someone break your heart inside? 

You're in ruins 



One, twenty-one guns 

Lay down your arms 

Give up the fight 

One, twenty-one guns 

Throw up your arms into the sky, 

You and I 



When you're at the end of the road 

And you lost all sense of control 

And your thoughts have taken their toll 

When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul. 



Your faith walks on broken glass 

And the hangover doesn't pass 

Nothing's ever built to last 

You're in ruins 



One, twenty-one guns 

Lay down your arms 

Give up the fight 

One, twenty-one guns 

Throw up your arms into the sky, 

You and I 



Did you try to live on your own? 

When you burned down the house and home? 

Did you stand too close to the fire? 

Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone 



When it's time to live and let die 

And you can't get another try 

Something side this heart has died 

You're in ruins... 



One, twenty-one guns 

Lay down your arms 

Give up the fight 

One, twenty-one guns 

Throw up your arms into the sky 



One, twenty-one guns 

Lay down your arms 

Give up the fight 

One, twenty-one guns 

Throw up your arms into the sky, 

You and I

A cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath 

the shade of a Georgia pine

And that`s home you know

Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine

Where the peaches grow

And my house it`s not much to talk about

But it`s filled with love that`s grown

in southern ground



And a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night

A pair of jeans that fit just right

And the radio up

Well I`ve seen the sunrise

See the love in my woman`s eyes

Feel the touch of a precious child

And know a mother`s love



And it's funny how it`s the little things in life 

that mean the most

Not where you live, what you drive, 

or the price tag on your clothes

There`s no dollar sign on a piece of mind 

this I`ve come to know

So if you agree have a drink with me

Raise you glasses for a toast



To a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night

A pair of jeans that fit just right

And the radio up

Well I`ve seen the sunrise

See the love in my woman`s eyes

Feel the touch of a precious child

And know a mother`s love



I thank God for my life

And for the stars and stripes

May freedom forever fly, let it ring

Salute the ones who died

And the ones that give their lives, so we don`t have to sacrifice

All the things we love



Like our chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night

A pair of jeans that fit just right

And the radio up

Well I`ve seen the sunrise

See the love in my woman`s eyes

Feel the touch of a precious child

And know a mother`s love



Get ya little chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night

A pair of jeans that fit just right

And the radio up

Well I`ve seen the sunrise

See the love in my woman`s eyes

Feel the touch of a precious child

And know a mother`s love

You had me mezmorized

In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight

Stronger than its ever been

We've come so far since that day

And I thought I loved you then

To right where I first met you

You were so suprised

There were people around

But I didn't care

I got down on one knee right there

And once again

I thought I loved you then

The way I feel about you girl

Like a river meets the sea

We've come so far since that day

And I thought I loved you then



I can just see you

With a baby on the way

I can just see you

When your hair is turning grey

What I can't see

Is how I'm ever gonna love you more

But I've said that before



Now you're my whole life

Now you're my whole world

I just can't believe

The way I feel about you girl

At this moment that we're in

Tries to close her eyes

She'll be alright

She'll be alright

It may not mean nothing to ya'll
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

I'm shutting shit down at the mall

And telling every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even planning to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

Last name ever, first name greatest

Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with

It started off local but thanks to all the haters

I know G4 pilots on a first name basis

And your city faded off to brown, nino

She insists she got more class, we know

Swimming in the money come and find me, nemo

If I was at the club you know I ball, kimo

Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album

Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome

Labels want my name beside the X like malcom

Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah, nigga I'm about my business

Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list

Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness

If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness

I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came

I went hard all fall like the ball teams

Just so I can make it rain all spring

Ya'll seen my story my glory

I had raped the game young you can call it statutory

When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues for me

Old money benjamin button, what nothin'

Now superbad chicks giving me MacLovin'

You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband

You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't

Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't

You're such a fucking loser

He didn't even go to class mueller

Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back

Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack

Chasing the stardom would turn you to a maniac

All the way in hollywood and I can't even act

They pull their cameras out and god damn they snap

I used to want this thing forever ya'll can have it back



[Chorus:]

It may not mean nothing to ya'll

But understand nothing was done for me

So I don't plan on stopping at all

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

I'm shutting shit down at the mall

And telling every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even planning to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man



[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]

Okay, hello it's the martian, space jam jordans

I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the Garden

Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target

If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans

And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops

Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top

Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops

But what should I scream for this is my theme park

My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark

Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk

Let the king talk check the price and pay attention

Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention

I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer

I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover

Shhhh, my foots sleeping on the gas

No brake pads no such thing as last



[Chorus:]

It may not mean nothing to ya'll

But understand nothing was done for me

So I don't plan on stopping at all

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

I'm shutting shit down at the mall

And telling every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even planning to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man



[Verse 4: Eminem]

There they go, back in stadiums as shady spits his flow

Nuts they go, macademia they go so ballistic whoa

He can make them look like posers, he's wondering if he should spit this slow

Fuck no go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no

He ain't had of a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed

They've been waiting patiently for pinnochio to poke his nose

Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as before

Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing a name as he goes

The passion of the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it

This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot

You dealin' with a few true villians, whose stayin' inside of the booth truth spillin'

And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths now rewind it

Payback motherfucker for the way that you doubted me hows it taste

When I slap the taste out of your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place

I'm hannibal lecters so just incase your thinking of saving face

You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place so drake



[Chorus:]

It may not mean nothing to ya'll

But understand nothing was done for me

So I don't plan on stopping at all

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

I'm shutting shit down at the mall

And telling every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even planning to call

I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man",2009.0

This world keeps spinning faster

Into a new disaster so I run to you

I run to you baby

And when it all starts coming undone

Baby you're the only one I run to

I run to you

Your life and mine

Like the sands of time

Slippin' right on through

And our love's the only truth

That's why I run to you

You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it
Slow motion, sparks
You've caught that chill

Now don't deny it

But boys will be boys

Oh, yes, they will

They don't wanna define it

Just give up the game and get into me

If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet



Oh, no I do not hook up, up I go slow

So if you want me, I don't come cheap

Keep your hand in my hand,

Your heart on your sleeve

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I fall deep

Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight

To say goodnight



I can't cook no, but I can clean

Up the mess she left

Lay your head down and feel the beat

As I kiss your forehead

This may not last but this is now

So love the one you're with

You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail

A quick fix won't ever get you well





Oh, no I do not hook up, up I go slow

So if you want me, I don't come cheap

Keep your hand in my hand,

Your heart on your sleeve

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I fall deep

Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight

To say...



Cause I feel

The distance

Between us

Could be over

With the snap of your finger

Oh no!



Oh, no I do not hook up, up I go slow

So if you want me, I don't come cheap

Keep your hand in my hand,

Your heart on your sleeve

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I fall deep

Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight

To say...

Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight

To say goodnight



Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down

Cause you don't wanna miss out

I never talk to him again 

Then one sunny day, I saw the old mans face 

Front page Obituary, he was a millionaree 

he left his fortune to some guy he barely knew, his kids were mad as hell 

But me, Im doing well 

And I drop by today, to just say thanks and pray, I left a six-pack right there on his grave and i said; God is great,
