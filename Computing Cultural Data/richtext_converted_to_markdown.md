**Computational Method Description:** Using the Time Series forecasting model Prophet, the authors of this article attempt to use existing data from the Shakespeare and Company project (based off of Sylvia Beach Papers at Princeton University) to create speculative data about the missing gaps in the dataset. 

**Argument Summary:**

The article argues that a speculative approach to datasets is significant because it allows researchers to critically engage with a dataset that might be biased or missing, which highlights the importance of questioning what is missing, marginalized, or distorted in digital collections. By using speculative reading, researchers can explore the implications of these gaps and challenge the perceived neutrality of data, revealing how power structures influence which texts are preserved or excluded. This process is experimental in that it inherently challenges the notion that data is neutral and unbiased. 

**Code Summary:**

The code consists of a github repo with a folder containing the datasets and source material from the Shakespeare and Company Project, as well as two folders containing jupyter notebooks that explore the missing data portions of the dataset, and one exploring the speculative reading portion. 

**What I Found Interesting:**

I found the way that the researchers used the Prophet library to be the most interesting. The researchers were meticulous in their application of the library to context informed situations in relation to Shakespeare and Company dataset. It was clear that they had thoroughly read about the habits of Sylvia Beach and how she had interacted with the patrons of the library, as well as most other details about how the library functioned as an institution and where its shortcomings might be. It was with this knowledge that then shaped their interactions with the data and the library. This knowledge of context is particularly important to speculative data approaches as trend forecasting just completely based off of training data would further augment the implicit biases. I would categorize this as the Digital Humanities approach. 

**Group Applications:**

Critically engaging with Billboard means questioning its stance as the arbiter of popularity and quality. As an institution, for the most part Billboard stands on its own as the measure of sales and distribution for music, and regardless of intent has become in large part a benchmark to be strived towards as a musical artist. Major label artists tend to dominate billboards as they possess the backing of labels to spread their music through the veins of the music industry. If our intent is to deeply understand the progression and changes of music and its related industries, then we must deconstruct billboard as a ruling institution and understand the currents of music and mediums beyond the surface level ranking that billboard provides. Using the same context centered approach as the authors of the article, we may be able to use these predictive models in conjunction with a well researched understanding of music history to gain insight on the gaps of billboard.
