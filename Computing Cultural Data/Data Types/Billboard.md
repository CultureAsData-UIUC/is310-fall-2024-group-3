## Data Type Description: 
- Billboard Music Data: 
BPM (Beats Per Minute): Numerical representation of song tempo.
Key Signature: Categorical data reflecting tonality (e.g., major/minor keys, sharp/flat keys).

- Socio-Economic Data:
General Hard Times Measure (GHTM): Composite numerical data encapsulating societal difficulties (e.g., unemployment, inflation).

## Article Argument Summary:
This article talks about how characteristics of Billboard songs, such as Tempo(BPMs) and key signature, changed with the socio-economic conditions of the United States between 1955 and 2008. The research showed that during times of socio-economic difficulty, slower tempos and sharp/flat key signatures are more prevalent in songs, reflecting a mood of introspection. And during periods of economic and social stability, faster tempos and standard key signatures dominate, signaling positivity and energy.

## Code Summary:
The authors did not explicitly show any code from their studies, however, they did use statistics strategies such as correlation analysis and time series modeling to strengthen their argumentã€‚These methods were applied to analyze the relationships between musical features (e.g., BPM and key signatures) and socio-economic indicators (e.g., General Hard Times Measure).

## Assessment of the work:
The most interesting and useful aspect of this research is that it shows how doing analysis on music can reflect the broader patterns in society. By analyzing musical characteristics such as tempo (BPM) and key signatures related to socio-economic conditions, the study illustrates how music changes with societal moods during periods of prosperity or hardship.

## Group Applications:
This article will help the group identify key variables, such as tempo (BPM) and key signatures, for analyzing music trends within a specific historical period. The research also demonstrates how cultural phenomena like music can be analyzed computationally to uncover societal trends, providing a template for connecting musical features to economic and social conditions. By understanding how music preferences vary across different socio-economic contexts, our group can explore not only trends within a single period but also comparatively analyze how different societies respond to similar factors. This could guide our project in predicting global music trends by applying computational methods to cultural data, and allow us to forecast how future social or economic conditions might change music preferences worldwide. Furthermore, expanding from this research, we can also focus on other dimensions of music analysis, such as lyrical sentiment, genre popularity, or regional listening behaviors, to gain a more comprehensive view of cultural responses.
