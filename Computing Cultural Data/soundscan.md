## Computational Method Description: 
This article talks about a new metric system and computational method fueled by a technology called SoundScan changed the way of how billboard top 100 were decided starting from the 90s. SoundScan is a tracking system. It works by logging the UPC, EAN, and ISRC codes (which is a unique identifier assigned to individual audio and video recordings.associated with a music product) when a sale transaction takes place. The tracking includes albums, singles, music videos, and even streaming which is useful because most current consumption is from streaming. In order for having a chance to make the billboard top 100 any release must be registered with soundscan using the upc for the entire album, and the isrc codes for the individual tracks, without registration the sales won’t be counted. The organization considers around 1500 streams equal to one traditional album sale. Use of BDS Broadcast Data Systems. 
## Argument Summary:
The article digs into the significant impact of the new technology of SoundScan in determining what music was considered Popular Music and would chart the top 100 billboard. Before soundscan, the sale numbers were self-reported by vendors and music stores. This led to the assumptions being made which were not very credible about what music was the most popular. SoundScan also revealed that music opened like movies, in which the majority of the sales occurred when the music was being first released. It also argues that SoundScan changed the rules on who got to be popular and be a star. This is because the accurate calculation of sales showed the degree of popularity of an artist. The introduction of soundscan affected the range of albums and songs that were a part of the bilboard charts. Sales of rap and country rose significantly after the introduction of Soundscan. 
## Code Summary:
SoundScan relies on APIs and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipelines to collect and process massive volumes of transactional data from retail outlets, streaming platforms, and digital music stores. These APIs interface with stores and streaming services to automatically pull sales and stream counts, often through secure real-time or periodic data feeds. The data also gets extensively cleansed before it is completely registered, making sure inconsistencies and duplicates are removed. The code is not specified but the processes are. 
## What I Found Interesting:
I found this article interesting because I never really knew how Billboard top 100 charts were created. This cleared up the question, and to put it in short, Billboard top 100 songs are the songs that sold the most. One thing that I found interesting in the article was that when SoundScan was first implemented, it showed which genres were being underrepresented. For example, after the introduction of SoundScan it was revealed that hard rock and heavy metal were way more popular than expected. SoundScan also increased the transparency in the music industry, and everyone could see who was selling how much and it was an accurate representation. 
## Group Applications:
Critically engaging with Billboard means understanding the technology behind the data collection, and how it is decided what is popular and top charting. Learning that the billboard decides what music is popular almost strictly on sales is important to understand. Also knowing the metric that about 1500 streams equal 1 traditional sale of an album is an important conversion metric to understand in today’s context. Knowing some of the details of the program used to collect the data is also important to know. It is also important to understand that the metric for popular music changed because of a change in the form of sale data collection.
