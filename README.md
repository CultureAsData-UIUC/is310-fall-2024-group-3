## Tentative Group Members

These members were selected because of your broad interests in music and performance, as well as just generally being interested in many cultural areas. You are not required to keep your group focused on this area for this project, but I share this broad overview to hopefully help spark initial brainstorming together.

_Please note this list of members is tentative and subject to change as students join or leave the class in the next week or so._

## Division of Labor
  Our team has not yet decided on who will take on each role in our group but considering the work that will be done weâ€™ve come up with the appropriate roles. Members of our group can take on multiple roles when needed. To start one or two members will work on __Data Collection and Analysis__. Once they have cleaned and prepared the data, they will choose appropriate method analyze the data to find patterns and trends. This role is very technical and we foresee one or two members spearheading this but at times the whole group will work on this role. The second role will be a __Visualization Specialist__. This role creates charts and interactive dashboards to illustrate our findings. The next role is __Research Specialist__, and this member will conduct literature reviews on shifts in music styles and genres, providing cultural context to support our findings. This can include Youtube videos, podcasts and other multimedia options. The last role will come later on when we shift to creating our own data. The __Survey Specialist__ will work to design the surveys to collect data on current music preferences, analyze the responses, and help integrate this information with our existing datasets.

  Each role will depend on each other, and this will allow a lot of cross-work and collaboration. For example, the Research Specialist will provide historical context to the Data Collection and Analysis team so they can focus on relevant trends. The Survey Specialist will collaborate with the Visualization Specialist to design surveys will be suitable for visuals. Additionally, the Survey Specialist will share initial survey results with the Research Specialist to enrich the literature review with contemporary data. Regular check-ins will keep all team members informed about progress and any potential delays, ensuring we stay on track. The Project Manager role will rotate among team members every two weeks. As the Project Manager that group member will oversee progress, facilitate meetings, and maintain communication, ensuring we are working efficiently.
