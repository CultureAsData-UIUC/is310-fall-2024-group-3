To be updated with a description for a collaborative semester long project

## Tentative Group Members

These members were selected because of your broad interests in music and performance, as well as just generally being interested in many cultural areas. You are not required to keep your group focused on this area for this project, but I share this broad overview to hopefully help spark initial brainstorming together.

_Please note this list of members is tentative and subject to change as students join or leave the class in the next week or so._

## Topics
Our group's general area of cultural interest is music. For our specific scope of focus we will be looking at the changing trends of music over the years as reflected by Spotify data. Although Spotify hasn’t been around for as long as the datasets claim to cover, it does have a massive amount of data about songs from a large range of time. The unique thing about using Spotify data is that almost every song has genre information written into the metadata. Furthermore each song has attributes that Spotify analyzes using their proprietary algorithms like danceability, or energy, that can give us information about the specific sonic preferences that may have evolved. Using this data we seek to understand the changes that have taken place across popular music history, as well as using historical perspective to understand how events and material conditions might influence these trends. Along with this we seek to apply this synthesis of history and trend analysis to our own self collected dataset about genre preferences and music discovery. What are people listening to now? What are the sources and factors that influence these preferences, and how do these compare and contrast to the past and near present? 
## Materials
To complete this project, we will likely rely heavily on existing digital materials from Spotify and related databases, rather than physical objects. Every year, Spotify releases publicly available music charts such as Billboard Hot 100 data with Spotify metrics and historical Spotify data that allow the team to analyze trends over time. Therefore, so far, we will use the dataset of Top 10000 Songs on Spotify 1960-Now and Billboard HOT 100 Songs Spotify Data (1946-2022) from Kaggle to compare historic and contemporary music trends. In order to have deeper insights of the trends in recent years, social media data such as Twitter or Youtube can help understand public sentiment and engagement with popular songs. Other music meta databases like MusicBrainz can offer us more comprehensive data relating artists, albums or release dates. In addition, taking advantage of academic papers or journal articles about shifts in music styles and genres can offer context for how music trends change over time with cultural or societal shifts. We may look up journal articles: The Geographic Flow of Music on Spotify to gain a deeper understanding of how music trends vary across different regions and cultures. Few challenges will definitely appear when doing this project. First, extracting a large amount of historical music data from Spotify or external databases might require time and effort in data cleaning or preprocessing. As for trend analysis, identifying and quantifying trends over time might involve complex modeling or statistical analysis, which our team may need to employ advanced regression models or machine learning algorithms to uncover patterns and predict future trends. Additionally, we may need expertise in data visualization to effectively communicate these trends. All of the work demands effective collaboration and communication within the team to ensure we use the best model to get the music trends accurately interpreted and contextualized within broader cultural or historic shifts in the music industry. 
## Division of Labor
Our team has not yet decided on who will take on each role in our group but considering the work that will be done we’ve come up with the appropriate roles. Members of our group can take on multiple roles when needed. To start one or two members will work on Data Collection and Analysis. Once they have cleaned and prepared the data, they will choose appropriate method analyze the data to find patterns and trends. This role is very technical and we foresee one or two members spearheading this but at times the whole group will work on this role. The second role will be a Visualization Specialist. This role creates charts and interactive dashboards to illustrate our findings. The next role is Research Specialist, and this member will conduct literature reviews on shifts in music styles and genres, providing cultural context to support our findings. This can include Youtube videos, podcasts and other multimedia options. The last role will come later on when we shift to creating our own data. The Survey Specialist will work to design the surveys to collect data on current music preferences, analyze the responses, and help integrate this information with our existing datasets.
Each role will depend on each other, and this will allow a lot of cross-work and collaboration. For example, the Research Specialist will provide historical context to the Data Collection and Analysis team so they can focus on relevant trends. The Survey Specialist will collaborate with the Visualization Specialist to design surveys will be suitable for visuals. Additionally, the Survey Specialist will share initial survey results with the Research Specialist to enrich the literature review with contemporary data. Regular check-ins will keep all team members informed about progress and any potential delays, ensuring we stay on track. The Project Manager role will rotate among team members every two weeks. As the Project Manager that group member will oversee progress, facilitate meetings, and maintain communication, ensuring we are working efficiently.

## Timeline
What is your timeline for completing tasks, given the remaining milestones and the focus of your project? Break down your project into manageable phases with specific deadlines, ensuring that you allocate enough time for data collection, analysis, and revisions. Consider any potential bottlenecks or challenges that might affect your timeline and how you will address them. This timeline should be realistic but also flexible enough to accommodate unforeseen issues.
For this project there are many different tasks that need to be planned out effectively to have them finished on time without a rush. The next  major deadline is October 10th with an optional extension to October 17th to have an attempt on gathering data displayed. That deadline is in about two weeks and it consists of creating and organizing a dataset and alongside it documenting how the data was found. We should start this process as of the 24th Sept and slowly work on curating the data. By the 1st of October, we should have at least a rough draft of the data ready. The rough draft should consist of the template for what all variables and observations we want. And the job for the next week from the 1st-8th should be to just add on and refine the dataset more to our liking. This whole week will be a time which is allotted to sort out any challenges that we face. And the 2 extra days from the 8-10 are for any emergencies or last minute issues. The next major deadline is on Nov 14th with an optional week extension. By this time we should have started experimenting with our data and used the results to refine our data even more. From October 10th-October 14th, we should choose our computational methods and start experimenting. From October to November 1st we should be applying the methods to our dataset and revise any problems that we see. The rest of the days leading up to the deadline will be buffer days to account for any issues that we face, and it will give us enough time to perfect the dataset to look how we want it. The next major milestone is the completion of the project which has a hard deadline of Dec. 10th. We will have basically a month from Nov 14th- Dec10th to complete the rest of the project. This gives us enough time to make any changes that we need and complete our analysis. If we follow this timeline, we should have more than enough time left over to fix up any issues that we have or address any challenges. 
This initial proposal must be submitted as part of your group’s GitHub repository, which will be thoroughly documented (a topic we will discuss in detail in class). You should aim for 750-1000 words and include relevant links to materials or scholarly sources. Feel free to incorporate tables, graphs, bullet points, or any other formats that will help you clearly outline the goals and plan for this project.
Ultimately, this proposal should lay the groundwork for your project and serve as your blueprint for the semester. It will guide your group’s work and ensure that you stay aligned with your research objectives.
In our first few weeks, we will be discussing what makes a good topic, and you are also welcome to schedule a meeting or contact the Instructor to brainstorm possible topics.
