**Step 1: Focusing on Cultural Areas**

*   Music & Sound: Investigate digital archives of music, sound recordings, or oral histories.
    

**Step 2: Exploring Digitization of Cultural Objects**

*   What might be considered a digital object or digital representation for your area of focus? You can have multiple examples, but you should explain why you consider it relating to your area of focus (this can be short though). **(yuktha)**
    
    *   **MIDI Files (musical instrument digital interface)**
        
        *   **Store musical performance data such as pitch, duration, intensity, instead of the actual sound. Allows for the manipulation of music, and is used a lot in music production.**
            
    *   **Digital Sheet music** 
        
        *   **Files representing musical notation in a digital format. It can be shared, edited, and played back, on software such as Musescore.**
            
    *   **Digital audio files such as MP3**
        
        *   **Direct digital representations of sound, show the audio data in a sharable and editable format.**
            
    *   **Analog recordings** 
        
        *   **Microphone turns air pressure (sound) into an electric analog signal, and the analog recording is made by imprinting that signal onto the master tape through magnetization or a master record through grooves. Then copies can be made into cassette tapes and vinyl records.** 
            
    *   **Digital recordings** 
        
        *   **Take an analog signal and convert it into a digital representation of the sound, basically a series of numbers for digital software to interpret. After the analog signal is digitized, the recording can be copied and placed onto a compact disc, or hard drive, or streamed online.** 
            
    *   **These relate to music & sound because they are important tools and representations used in the creation, manipulation, and sharing of digital music.** 
        
*   How are digital objects and representations created for your area of focus? What are the processes involved in digitizing these objects? In the African American Periodical Poetry (1900-1928) dataset, we learned about the process of digitizing periodicals and Kahle also mentioned a process called OCR, Optical Character Recognition, for extracting text from digitized print materials. What are some of the digitization processes for your area of focus? **(Jeff)**
    
    *   Digitizing analog audio mediums rely on DAC’s (Digital to Analog Converters) to convert continuous analog audio signals to discrete digital forms. DAC’s are found in almost all digital technologies that interface with sound, but oftentimes specialized DAC’s are used if digitizing for higher fidelity. These DAC’s have multiple forms and configurations, but all serve to convert the infinite amplitude levels of a continuous signal and “sample” this signal into finite discrete chunks, by chopping the signal into a bunch of really small parts and individually calculating the average amplitude for these small portions. Done enough times and finely enough these sampled portions can effectively approximate the signal of analog audio, but in a way that can be digitally represented through binary. 
        

*   Oftentimes analog mediums require a player that can interface directly with the recorded medium, cassettes require a cassette player that have magnetic cassette heads that can read and/or write the magnetic data stored on the cassette tape. Vinyl records require record players that have needles to convert the mechanical energy stored in the cut grooves of the record to electrical energy, which is then amplified using a preamplifier and/or converted using DAC to be digitized. 
    

*   Digitizing usually involves playing the analog medium in real time while connected through cables, amplifiers and converters to a computer. Using an audio recording software or digital audio workstation, one selects the input as the external recording device, and records in real time as it plays. Cassette → Cassette Deck → Audio Interface → Ableton. Files can then be exported as WAV/MP3/FLAC files.  
    
*   Kahle repeatedly made reference to the Library of Alexandria in his article. What are some historical equivalents to digital objects in your area of focus? How do these historical objects compare to their digital counterparts?**(Shoi)**
    
    *   **Collections of Sheet Music**
        
        *   Earlier sheet music used to be the only way to store and contain musical information. It has preserved and held thousands of records of compositions since the renaissance. The digital counterpart of sheet music are apps and files that contain sheet music or tabs. The advantage of the digital files is that they can easily be copied and distributed. Whereas, the physical sheet music is harder to distribute, and also has to be handled with care because it is subject to wear.
            
    *   Collections of Vinyl Records
        
        *   This was one of the earliest sound recording technologies. This technology could both capture and replay songs and sound through a phonograph. This technology was easier to copy but distribution was still difficult. Large collections of vinyl records hold a plethora of musical information. Music now is digitally recorded and digitally replayed. This allows for edits to be made more efficiently and accurately. Digital storage of songs also takes up less physical space and there’s also no care required. A simple scratch on a vinyl record could make it lose its informational value which makes it harder to maintain and care for. 
            
    *   Collection of Magnetic Tapes
        
        *   Tape recordings expanded the functionality of sound recording. It allowed for higher quality recording and it also increased the efficiency and quality of editing and mixing. A collection of magnetic tapes provides better quality records of music and sound from the past. This compared to the digital counterparts, the process of recording and playing is still inefficient. There is a likelihood of physical deterioration of magnetic tapes. Digital editing also allows for more advanced and precise changes when editing and mixing. 
            
*   Relatedly, are there examples of born-digital materials for your area of focus? How do these materials compare to digitized objects? For those unfamiliar, born-digital materials are those that were created digitally and never existed in analog or physical form (think most social media, for example). **(Jeff)**
    
    *   Since the invention of digital recording, and especially today, new music is often created directly to digital mediums, meaning that it does not need to be digitized.
        
    *   Any audio created by vibrations of the air in the material world still needs to undergo analog to digital conversion to be recorded in the digital recording format, which is the conversion trade off for digital recording. Previously things could be recorded in analog to tape. In the modern day if you wanted to digitize those recordings you could only do the entire printed recording and not the stems. Digital recordings instead integrate the conversion process with the recording process, allowing each individual recording to be manipulated and stored with the flexibility of digital computation. 
        
    *   The widespread sharing of music and sound through online networks and platforms is an invention that is purely digital in nature. Previously analog recording needed some sort of physical medium to be distributed. Digital mediums where first was popularized through CD’s which were physical, but eventually the files that CD’s played began to be shared by themselves. Furthermore, any digital sound storage file type is completely born digital. 
        
    *   As previously mentioned by Yuktha, MIDI data is also a born digital interface. It allows for the control of software instruments by being a virtual interface to describe note pitch, length, velocity and other expressions. MIDI was initially designed for use by hardware synthesizers to be controlled by sequencers in the early 1980’s, but is now widely implemented in all digital recording and composing platforms. 
        
    

*   What is the oldest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your area of focus? How has this resource been maintained and updated over time? You may also include examples that are no longer maintained or have been abandoned. **(yuktha)**
    
*   Conversely, what is the newest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your area of focus? How does this resource compare to older digital libraries or archives?**(Shoi)**
    
    *   Apps such as Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube Music, and Pandora are some of the newer digital libraries of music. 
        
        *   These resources are subscription based music streaming services that offer millions of songs across different genres, languages, and artists. 
            
        *   These platforms allow for personalization and one can create their own playlist of songs according to their music taste, and they can choose from all the songs that are part of the library of the database
            
        *   The older digital libraries before these streaming platforms were the Itunes store and the Amazon music store. With these resources you could buy independent tracks or albums. This is one of the key differences from the streaming platforms because the Itunes store would give you ownership of the track that you bought whereas Spotify gives access to users to an extensive library without requiring ownership
            
        *   This movement towards information being redistributed in real time streaming creates a new trend of music consumption which is based more on accessibility, efficiency, and personalization instead of storage, preservation and ownership. 
            
    *   In terms of music creation and mixing, one of the most significant and extensive digital music libraries is Splice.
        
        *   Splices library contains high quality sound samples that users can save and store on the cloud so it can be accessed from anywhere
            
        *   An earlier form of this library could be The British Library Sounds Archive, or the The Library of Congress' Recorded Sound Section. The difference between the older archives and Splice is the accessibility and way organization of the catalog.
            

**Are there any examples of your digital object that have gone viral? How did this happen and what impact did it have on the object or the digital library/archive that hosted it?  (Weiting)** 

Viral Digital Objects:

**"Baby Shark Dance" from Pinkfong on YouTube**

**How it Went Viral:** Initially uploaded to YouTube as part of a children's educational series, "Baby Shark" exploded in popularity through organic sharing on social media. Parents, children, and teachers circulated the song, making it one of the most viewed videos on the platform. Viral challenges like the #BabySharkChallenge also contributed to its spread.

**Impact:** The viral success of "Baby Shark" catapulted Pinkfong’s digital presence on YouTube, increasing subscriptions to its channel and driving traffic to its other educational content. It also led to merchandise, tours, and licensing deals, impacting Pinkfong’s entire brand and expanding its digital library's cultural reach.

Impact on Digital Libraries and Archives:

**Commercial Opportunities:** Viral objects can lead to commercial success, not just for the creators but for the platforms themselves. Pinkfong’s "Baby Shark" turned into a multimillion-dollar brand, and SoundCloud benefited from the viral nature of "Harlem Shake" by drawing more attention to its platform as a space for emerging and viral music trends.

**Challenges in Rights Management:** Viral objects can sometimes raise legal and ethical questions around copyright, particularly when proprietary content is involved. For example, viral remixes of songs may lead to disputes over usage rights or royalties, which can affect both the artists and the platforms.
