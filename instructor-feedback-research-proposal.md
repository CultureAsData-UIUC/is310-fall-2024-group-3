## Instructor Feedback on Initial IS310 Project Proposal

Overall, your group has a solid foundation and some great ideas for your semester-long project. Your focus on music trends using Spotify data is an interesting and relevant choice, especially given the rich metadata that Spotify provides. I also appreciated your detailed description of roles and your attention to the timeline for submitting project milestones. However, there are several areas where your proposal could be refined to ensure the scope is manageable and that you meet the course’s requirements:

- **File Organization & Structure**: Your group's repository looks generally good, though I’m curious why you decided to place the entire project proposal in the README? Do you plan to leave it that way for the rest of the semester, or will you move it to a separate file? I’d personally recommend moving the proposal to a separate document (e.g., proposal.md) so that your README can focus more on summarizing your project as it evolves. However, am open to your rationale for this decision. Additionally, the inclusion of the assignment prompt in the proposal felt a bit confusing to read. Going forward, I’d suggest removing any extraneous text like this from your milestone submissions to keep things clear and focused on your own work.

- **Research Question & Scope**: While your overall research topic is exciting and relevant to the course, I'm concerned that your current project proposal has a massive scope that needs significant narrowing to be feasible. For instance, I appreciate that you seem to be interested in studying Spotify metadata but even the question "What are people listening to now?" requires further defining. Which people do you mean? Are all demographics the same historically? What do you mean by listening? Is that streaming or is it the Billboard charts? How does the economics of the music industry shape both Spotify and Billboard, and also influence what you might mean by listening? Finally, now seems obvious but is that a particular day that you are planning to select or a set of years? 

As you are starting to get a sense from my questions, narrowing a research question is a key part of the research process. I would recommend focusing on a specific genre, time period, or region to make your project more manageable. For example, you could focus on a specific genre like hip-hop or a specific time period like the 2000s. This would allow you to dive deeper into the data and draw more meaningful conclusions. I do like your focus on Spotify metadata so you might also try to look at the history of Spotify itself, how it has changed over time, and whether you can find traces of that in the data it has released (just a potential research focus though!).

- **Data Sources & Validation**: You list a number of potential data sources (Billboard and Spotify datasets from Kaggle, social media data, Music Brainz, etc.) which is great, but you need to start thinking about how you will assess and contextualize those datasets. For instance, how will you verify that the Spotify datasets you are using compared to the actual cultural object it is representing? Have you tried to find any of the original songs on Spotify to see if the metadata matches up or even the physical albums? Remember that for this assignment you are welcome to use existing data but you have to actually investigate and try to assess it's relationship to the objects it purports to represent. Also please remember that you will need to augment this existing data, though I think by combining multiple sources that should be sufficient as long as the sources aren't all the exact same data from the Spotify API. Happy to consult further if you are ensure though!

- **Methodologies & Analysis**: I like the idea of using existing scholarship to focus your project, but I'm a bit concerned about the level of complexity in the paper you mentioned, as well as your proposed computational methodologies. Have you done machine learning or statistical analyses before? For example, you write "we use the best model to get the music trends accurately interpreted and contextualized within broader cultural or historic shifts in the music industry." How will you assess what is "best" or "accurate"? This topic is one we will be discussing in class, but I would recommend trying to find some Digital Humanities research exploring music, which will help you both get a sense of what methods might be relevant and also how to best apply those methods to the data. If you are struggling to find relevant research, I am happy to consult!

- **Division of Labor & Timeline**: I think you have a good start on the division of labor,  but I think it would be helpful to start to actually discuss who will do each role. Furthermore, I would also recommend thinking more about how you will manage the potential bottlenecks and challenges that you've identified given you proposed division of labor. For instance, what happens if collecting and curating the data takes longer than anticipated? How will that impact the other roles? I would recommend revising this division of labor to ensure that the project isn't stalled if a task takes longer than expected, and also revise the timeline to be more focused on specific tasks and deadlines for each role. Finally, I would also start thinking about how you might iterate and start with a more narrow ambition and then try to expand as you go (so, thinking about maybe an initial test dataset that you pilot and then expand on once you've started to work through the data collection, curation, and experimentation workflows).

Overall, I think you have a strong foundation for your project, but I would recommend focusing on narrowing your research question, validating your data sources, and refining your division of labor and timeline. If you have any questions or need further guidance, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Good work so far!
