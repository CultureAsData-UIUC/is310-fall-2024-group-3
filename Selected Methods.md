## Selected Methods


### Correlation Analysis and Time Series Modeling (And the Beat Goes On"):
- Application: Use correlation analysis to identify relationships between song characteristics (e.g., tempo, key signature) and socio-economic variables like the General Hard Times Measure.
- Additional Methods: Time series modeling could help track how these relationships evolve over time and highlight shifts in music trends as they correlate with economic conditions.

### Speculative Data and Gap Analysis with Prophet (Missing Data, Speculative Reading):
- Application: Use the Prophet model to account for missing or incomplete data, especially if you have periods in Billboard data with gaps or anomalies. This can help in creating speculative insights and identifying potential biases or missing factors within the data.
- Additional Insights: Prophetâ€™s approach can also be used to forecast potential future trends, examining how predicted economic shifts may influence music preferences.

### K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering (What Makes a Song Trend?"):
- Application: K-means clustering can help categorize Billboard data into different musical clusters based on attributes like tempo, energy, and valence. Use agglomerative clustering to validate the number of clusters for a reliable grouping of song features.
- Additional Insights: Cluster analysis will reveal which characteristics dominate in popular music and how these clusters shift over time, potentially correlating with socio-economic conditions.
